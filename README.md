Hi👋 I'm Muhammad Arslan
Assalamualaikum!

I'm Muhammad Arslan, a dedicated Flutter Developer with over a year of experience in creating visually appealing and functional applications. Recently, I completed a comprehensive Flutter Development course from Tech Idara Karachi Online, which has equipped me with the latest skills and knowledge in the field.

During my time as a Flutter Developer at Home Town, I gained hands-on experience in building applications tailored to client needs, enhancing my practical skills in the process. My expertise includes Flutter UI design, API integration, Firebase backend, and state management using Provider, Bloc, and Cubits.

I have a passion for collaborating with other developers and designers to create applications that not only meet but exceed client expectations. I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices, regularly attending professional courses to refine my skills.

My goal is to deliver applications that are both user-friendly and visually stunning, ensuring they align perfectly with the client's brand and business objectives.
